# SQL Results Formatting Enhancement Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the changes made to enhance the SQL query results display in the QueryIO chat interface. The updates ensure that SQL query results are consistently displayed with:

1. A Markdown-formatted table of results (with headers and rows)
2. A fenced SQL code block showing the exact query run
3. A one-sentence human-readable summary

## Implementation Details

### 1. System Prompt Updates

Both API endpoints now instruct the LLM to format SQL query results with more structured outputs:

- Files modified:
  - `app/api/connections/[id]/query/route.ts`
  - `app/api/connections/[id]/query/stream/route.ts`

- Key additions to the system prompt:
  ```
  When you return query results:
  1. For the "data" field, ensure all columns and rows are properly formatted
  2. For COUNT(*) queries or any aggregate function, always alias as snake_case of the metric (e.g., COUNT(*) AS user_count)
  3. In the "explanation" field, provide a brief one-sentence summary like "You currently have X users." or "The sales in Q1 were $Y higher than Q2."
  ```

### 2. JSON Envelope Enhancement

The JSON schema was extended to include a data field for structured table data:

```json
{
  "outputType": "table",
  "data": { 
    "columns": ["col1", "..."], 
    "rows": [[val1, ...], ...] 
  },
  "sql": "<exact SELECT statement>",
  "explanation": "<one-sentence summary>"
}
```

### 3. SQL Alias Convention Enforcement

Added instructions for the LLM to follow proper aliasing conventions:
- All `COUNT(*)` should be aliased as `count` or snake_case of the metric
- This makes table headers more readable in the UI

### 4. Frontend Rendering Updates

- Files modified:
  - `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

- Added:
  - ReactMarkdown library for rendering markdown tables
  - Helper functions to generate Markdown tables from JSON data
  - Logic to detect and render Markdown content in messages

## Testing Instructions

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test with example queries:**
   - "How many users do we have?"
   - "Show me the top 5 products by revenue."
   - "Compare sales between Q1 and Q2 of this year."

3. **Expected output format:**
   - For each query, you should see:
     - A neatly formatted Markdown table with proper headers and data
     - The SQL query used in a syntax-highlighted code block
     - A brief summary sentence below the results

## Technical Details

### Helper Functions Added

1. `generateMarkdownTable`: Converts JSON data into a Markdown-formatted table
2. `formatCell`: Properly formats cell values based on data type (numbers, text, etc.)

### UI Improvements

1. Tables are now rendered with Markdown styling rather than raw HTML
2. SQL queries are displayed in syntax-highlighted code blocks
3. Summary sentences provide quick insights at a glance

## Troubleshooting

If the formatted tables are not displaying correctly:

1. Ensure react-markdown is properly installed: `npm install react-markdown`
2. Check browser console for any rendering errors
3. Verify the LLM is returning the proper JSON structure by checking network responses
